### Project Description:

Our project is a terminal version of the board game Risk. The game is played between two players and the objective of the game is to see which player takes over all the territories and domniates the map! At the beginning of the game, players cycle through turns and claims territories by placing troops until each and every territory in the map is owned by either players. Once that is done, the players can place troops, attack other territories, or fortify existing territories. Once a player has eliniminated the other player by taking control of all the land, they are crowned the winner!
